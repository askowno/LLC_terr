#### National Land Cover Change

Land cover change spatial analysis for the 2025 National Biodiversity Assessment There are two versions of the cross-tabulation of land cover and vegetation types:

a)  LCC including SA Lesotho and Swaziland [LC_change_7class_veg24.qmd](LC_change_7class_veg24.qmd) for the Red List of Ecosystems assessments);

b)  LCC excluding Lesotho and Eswatini [LC_change_7class_veg24_SAonly.qmd](LC_change_7class_veg24_SAonly.qmd) for Ecosystem Area Index and national statistics. Only the SOuth African extent of each ecosystem is considered.

### Alternative land cover and ecosystem condition data from conservation authorities

Land cover and ecosystem condition products prepared by provinical or metropolitan environmental authorities and major region environmental programmes have high confidence estimates and, due to their more local focus and extensive error correction and validation steps. Where available these data are used in conjunction with national data sets to estimate remaining extent of selected ecosystem types and to estimate the extent (required for Criterion A) and severity of functional declines (required for Criterion D).

1.  Western Cape Provincial Land Cover (Cape Nature, 2022). Data supplied in ESRI GRID format, converted to a TIFF in ARCGIS PRO, 10 m data (UTM34S) resampled to match 20m and Albers Equal Area national land cover grid. Reclassified to match the NLC classes.

2.  KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Land Cover (Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, 2017). Data supplied in ESRI gdb format, converted to a TIFF in ARCGIS PRO, 20 m data (UTM35S) resampled to match 20m and Albers Equal Area national land cover grid. Reclassified to match the NLC classes.

3.  Mpumalanga Provincial Land Cover (MPTA, 2017). Data supplied in ESRI gdb format, converted to a TIFF in ARCGIS PRO, 20 m data (UTM35S) resampled to match 20m and Albers Equal Area national land cover grid. Reclassified to match the NLC classes.

4.  National Land Cover (7 class version prepared by SANBI) 2022.

5.  National Vegetation Map 2024 version, vector data (ESRI file geodatabase) January 2025 curated by SANBI [@rutherford2006; @Dayaram2019].

### Analysis

The ecosystem data (vegetation types), NLC, WC, KZN and MPL data were cross tabulated and then summarised to assess Criterion A3 of the IUCN RLE.
